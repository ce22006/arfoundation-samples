# AR Foundation samples

[AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@6.4/manual/index.html) enables you to create multi-platform augmented reality (AR) apps with Unity. This GitHub repository contains AR Foundation samples, the official AR Foundation sample app that you can download, build to your device, and use as a starting point for your own projects.

This project demonstrates the following AR Foundation implementations:

| **Platform**   | **Plug-in** |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| **Android**    | [Google ARCore XR Plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arcore@6.4/manual/index.html) |
| **iOS**        | [Apple ARKit XR Plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arkit@6.4/manual/index.html) |
| **Meta Quest** | [Unity OpenXR: Meta](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.meta-openxr@2.4/manual/index.html) |
| **Android XR** | [Unity OpenXR: Android XR](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.androidxr-openxr@1.0/manual/index.html) |

Each AR Foundation feature is used in a minimal sample scene with example code that you can modify or copy into your project.
